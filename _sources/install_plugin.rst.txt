Install Plugin
=====================
   If the plugin is not installed yet, you must do this by following
   these steps:

   #. Navigate to the Menu Bar, select ‘Plugins’
   #. Choose ‘Manage and Install Plugins’
   #. In the search bar, type 'QTalsim'. 
   #. Select the 'QTalsim' plugin from the search results
   #. Click the ‘Install Plugin’ button
   #. The plugin is now installed and can be used

   Once the plugin is installed you can access it by going to the menu
   bar, selecting ‘Vector’ and then choosing ‘QTalsim’.

   QTalsim logs information about the processing steps in the processing log. You can open the processing log either by clicking the bubble button in the bottom right 
   corner of QGIS or by selecting "View" -> "Panels" and then selecting "Log Messages". The log messages of QTalsim are logged in the QTalsim tab.
