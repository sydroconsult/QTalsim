## \[1.6.0] - 2024-10-25

  * Fixes ordering issue for ASCII outputs to ensure they are ordered by ID columns

## \[1.4.1] - 2024-07-12

* Bug fixes

  * Fixes issue for dissolve of final BOA and LNZ layer by only dissolving by land use/soil Features
  * Fixes issue of selecting wrong feature-ids for soil layer

    * Feature-ID of input soil layer is now used if user selects "Feature IDs of Soil Layer"

* Enhancement

  * Update Minimum QGIS-Version to 3.34

## \[1.4.0] - 2024-06-19

* Bug fixes

  * Fixes issues for invalid geometries in intersection process
  * Fixes issues for invalid geometries in editing overlapping features process
  * Fixes issues when deleting feature with multiple overlaps

* Overlaps with an area smaller than 10 mÂ² are ignored and are not deleted by the plugin
* Add more user feedback for processes
* Add possibility to eliminate small polygons before intersection process

* Enhance speed of editing overlapping features

## \[1.3.1] - 2024-05-15

* Bug fixes

  * Fixes issue where intersection did not work (Fixes [Issue #15](https://github.com/sydroconsult/QTalsim/issues/15)).
  * Fixes issue of handling of land uses without land use type (Fixes [Issue #14](https://github.com/sydroconsult/QTalsim/issues/14)).

* Change logic of elimination process during intersection

  * Sum of areas of all features with the same parameters is calculated and compared to minimum size and minimum share (rather than each spatial feature itself).

* Add user feedback for processes and also add visual indication ([Issue #12](https://github.com/sydroconsult/QTalsim/issues/12)).
* Change names of edited layers (add name of optional editing step: overlap/gaps removal) ([Issue #11](https://github.com/sydroconsult/QTalsim/issues/11)).
* Add possibility to choose intermediate results in layers drop-down menus ([Issue #10](https://github.com/sydroconsult/QTalsim/issues/10)).

  * Fixes issue where raster layers in QGIS project resulted in Python error (Fixes [Issue #3](https://github.com/sydroconsult/QTalsim/issues/3)).

* Add functionalities to "Connect to Talsim DB"

  * Add functionality to also edit transport-reaches and system elements.
  * Add functionality to update attributes.
  * Allow users to use external layers with different CRS than WGS84 (See [Issue #8](https://github.com/sydroconsult/QTalsim/issues/8)).
