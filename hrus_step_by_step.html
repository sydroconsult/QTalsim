<blockquote>
<div><p>This part of the plugin was implemented to eliminate small polygons. Soil polygons and/or land use areas that fall below the specified size or percentage are eliminated.
The percentage of all features with the same parameters is calculated by comparing the size of the polygons to its sub-basin’s area. These polygons are eliminated when confirming the soil/land use mapping, using the chosen elimination mode.</p>
<p>Secondly, HRUs are eliminated according to the specified parameters (sub-basin, soil and land use) during the intersection process. HRUs that fall below the specified size or percentage share are deleted and filled using the ‘Eliminate’ tool.
You can select the elimination mode from the drop-down menu (find further information
<a class="reference external" href="https://docs.qgis.org/3.28/en/docs/user_manual/processing_algs/qgis/vectorgeometry.html?highlight=eliminate#eliminate-selected-polygons">here</a>).</p>
<p>Tip: You can apply different minimum sizes for soil/land use features and HRUs by adjusting the values before the desired step. For example, you can change the values before mapping the land use features or before the intersection process.</p>

<p>Choose the soil layer from the drop-down menu and confirm your

<p>This table contains Talsim soil parameters in the first column
and all the field names of the soil layer in drop-down menus in
the other six columns. These six columns represent the soil layers. In this step, users are required to map each
Talsim parameter to its corresponding fields in the soil layer.
The table below shows the necessary type for these parameters. Additionally, it also shows the required unit and restrictions of the parameters. If the user-mapped field has a different datatype, the plugin,
where possible, converts the field’s values to the parameter’s
type. If ‘Parameter not available’ is selected, that parameter
will be added with null values.</p>
<p>To finalize the soil mapping, click ‘Confirm Soil Mapping’. If the user
defines area/percentage thresholds, soil features below these thresholds are
deleted during this step. The user can set a minimum size of
the soil features [m²] and a minimum percentage of the soil features relative to the
sub-basin’s area. Soil features that fall below the specified size or
percentage share are deleted and filled using the
‘Eliminate’-tool.
This creates a new layer, containing all fields from the soil
layer and all parameters from the soil mapping table, assigned
with values from their corresponding fields. If there is a
datatype mismatch between the soil layer’s field and the
parameter, a warning is logged.</p>

perform some editing steps. Please refer to section <a class="reference external" href="#optional-editing-steps">Optional
Editing Steps</a> below for a detailed
explanation of ‘Check for Overlapping Features’, ‘Delete
Overlapping Features’, ‘Check for Gaps’ and ‘Fill Gaps’.</p>
<p>In addition to the option of deleting all overlapping parts
(using button ‘Delete All Overlapping Features’), you can also
selectively remove specific overlapping soil features. This can
be done via the table that populates when you click ‘Check for
Overlapping Features’. This table displays all overlapping soil
features across two columns. For each pair of overlapping
features, you can decide, which feature’s geometry should stay
unchanged, and which should have its overlapping part removed
from its geometry. In the third column, you can select features
to highlight them in the soil layer, allowing for easy viewing.
After you have identified all the unwanted overlapping parts,
simply press ‘Delete overlapping part of selected Features’ to
remove the overlapping parts from the selected features.</p>

so, all valid geometries of this layer are selected and clipped
to align with the boundaries of the sub-basin layer. During
this process, any duplicate geometries within the layer are

<p>The land use mapping table is populated similarily to the soil mapping table. The first column contains Talsim land use parameters and the second column contains drop-down menus with all field names of the input land use layer.
Here, you must match each Talsim parameter (in the first column) with the corresponding field in the input layer (in the second column).
The table below shows the necessary types for these parameters. Additionally, it also shows the required unit and restrictions of the parameters. If the user-mapped field has a different datatype, the plugin,
where possible, converts the field’s values to the parameter’s
type. If ‘Parameter not available’ is selected, that parameter
will be added with null values. Only for pTAW 0,5 is used as default value, if the user does not insert a parameter.</p>
<p>After completing the mapping, click ‘Confirm Landuse Mapping’ to create a new
layer containing the input fields from your layer and the
Talsim parameter values. If the user defines area/percentage thresholds, land use features below these thresholds are
deleted during this step. The user can set a minimum size of
the land use features [m²] and a minimum percentage of the land use features relative to the
corresponding sub-basin’s area. Land use features that fall below the specified size or

This model is used to calculate the mean slope for each of the created HRUs.
To generate the HRUs, the three layers (sub-basins, soil and land use) are
intersected in a first step. The user can set a minimum size of
the HRUs [m²] and a minimum percentage of HRUs relative to the
sub-basin’s area (see above). The sum of the areas of all HRUs with the same parameters is
compared with the area of the corresponding sub-basin. HRUs that fall below the specified size or

<ul>
<li><p>ASCII-Export</p>
<p>To export in ASCII format, users need to specify only the ASCII file name. The plugin will generate all relevant files with the appropriate extensions (.EFL, .BOD, .BOA, .LNZ), ensuring compatibility with Talsim NG4.</p>
</li>
<li><p>SQLite Export</p>

<li><p><strong>Check for Overlapping Features</strong></p>
<p>This function checks for overlapping features within the layer. It
identifies features that are either partially or completely
overlapping. The overlapping part must be greater than 10 m²; otherwise, it is ignored. Therefore, overlapping parts
below 10 m² are not indicated in the table and are not removed by the plugin.
The feature IDs of the overlapping features are logged in the
QTalsim-Log and are also indicated in a table below this button. Additionally, a layer named ‘Layer with
overlapping features’ is added to the QGIS project. You can then
inspect the overlapping features by reviewing this layer’s
attribute table by searching for the overlapping feature IDs or by selecting the features in the table (see “Delete Overlapping Part of selected Features”).</p>
<p><img alt="Check for overlapping Features" src="_images/CheckOverlappingFeatures.png" /></p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Delete All Overlapping Features</strong></p>
<p>This function removes all overlapping parts of a layer. The overlapping part must be greater than 10 m²;
otherwise, it is ignored. Therefore, overlapping parts below 10 m² are not removed by the plugin. If two
polygons overlap, the overlapping part is assigned to the smaller
of the two polygons.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Delete Overlapping Part of selected Features</strong></p>
<p>In addition to the option of deleting all overlapping parts
(using button ‘Delete All Overlapping Features’), you can also
selectively remove specific overlapping soil/land use features. This can
be done via the table that populates when you click ‘Check for
Overlapping Features’. This table displays all overlapping soil/land use
features across two columns. Remember, it only shows overlapping parts that are greater than 10 m². For each pair of overlapping
features, you can decide, which feature’s geometry should stay
unchanged, and which should have its overlapping part removed
from its geometry. In the third column, you can select features
to highlight them in the soil layer, allowing for easy viewing.
After you have identified all the unwanted overlapping parts,
simply press ‘Delete overlapping part of selected Features’ to
remove the overlapping parts from the selected features.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Check for Gaps</strong></p>
<p>This function checks for gaps in the soil/land use layer. It
identifies not only gaps within the layer itself but also gaps
that occur along the boundary of the sub-basin layer. A separate
layer, which includes all detected gaps from the soil or land use
layer, is then added to the QGIS project. This allows the user to
inspect and analyze these gaps more closely.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Fill Gaps</strong></p>
<p>This function fills all detected gaps in the layer using the
Eliminate-tool. You can specify the elimination-mode from a
drop-down menu (find further information
<a class="reference external" href="https://docs.qgis.org/3.28/en/docs/user_manual/processing_algs/qgis/vectorgeometry.html?highlight=eliminate#eliminate-selected-polygons">here</a>).
The result of this step is a layer free of gaps and matching the
extent of the sub-basin layer.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>In general, it is recommended to delete the overlaps before and after filling gaps.
Particularly complex geometric structures may result in new overlaps or gaps.
The plugin in some cases may struggle to automatically fill very small gaps or
delete very small overlaps, particularly for complex geometries.
If overlaps &amp; gaps persist after several attempts to delete overlaps and fill gaps, manual deletion is recommended (if necessary).</p>
