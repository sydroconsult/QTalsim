HRU calculation
===============

   HRU calculation is one core functionality of the QGIS plugin QTalsim,
   designed to create hydrological response units (HRUs) suitable for Talsim. 
   The plugin processes three layer, including a sub-basin layer, soil layer 
   and land use layer. It clips the layers in accordance with the sub-basin layerâ€™s boundaries. The plugin then intersects those three layers and creates HRUs.
   Additionally, the plugin offers functionality to remove duplicate geometries, overlapping features and unwanted gaps.
