about=QTalsim is designed to create hyrological response units (HRUs) suitable for Talsim. The plugin processes three layers, including a catchment area layer, soil layer and land use layer. It clips the layers in accordance with the catchment area layerâ€™s boundaries. The plugin then intersects those three layers and creates HRUs. Additionally, the plugin offers functionality to remove duplicate geometries, overlapping features and unwanted gaps.
