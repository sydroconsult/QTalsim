about=QTalsim is designed to create hydrological response units (HRUs) suitable for Talsim. The plugin processes three layers, including a sub-basins layer, soil layer and land use layer. It clips the layers in accordance with the catchment area layerâ€™s boundaries. The plugin then intersects those three layers and creates HRUs. Additionally, the plugin offers functionality to remove duplicate geometries, overlapping features and unwanted gaps.
