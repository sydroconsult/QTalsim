# QTalsim

QTalsim is a QGIS plugin with four principal functionalities that enable the processing of spatial data suitable for [Talsim](https://www.talsim.de/docs/index.php?title=Hauptseite/en). 

Firstly, it enables users to calculate Hydrological Response Units (HRUs). Secondly, the plugin faciliates a direct connection to a Talsim database, enabling users to edit system elements, sub-basins and transport reaches. The third functionality allows the user to preprocess sub-basins and calculate the longest flowpaths for each sub-basin. Another functionality downloads data from ISRIC and creates layers containing the soil type and bulk density for a given input area.
